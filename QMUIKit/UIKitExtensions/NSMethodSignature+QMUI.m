    // from a C string. -methodSignatureForSelector is called when a compiled definition for the selector cannot be found.
    // This is the place where we have to create our own dud NSMethodSignature. This is necessary because if this method
    // returns nil, a selector not found exception is raised. The string argument to -signatureWithObjCTypes: outlines
    // the return type and arguments to the message. To return a dud NSMethodSignature, pretty much any signature will
    // suffice. Since the -forwardInvocation call will do nothing if the delegate does not respond to the selector,
    // the dud NSMethodSignature simply gets us around the exception.
